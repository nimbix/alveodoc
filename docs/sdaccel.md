# Getting Started with SDAccel

## Introduction

The SDAccel Environment, a member of the SDx™ family of development environments for systems and software engineers, enables up to 25X better performance/watt for data center application acceleration leveraging FPGAs. Nimbix Inc® has partnered with Xilinx® to deliver an opportunity to test drive SDAccel and see how FPGA-based acceleration can speed-up your OpenCL C, C/C++ and RTL Kernels. The Nimbix Cloud provides a purpose-built compute cloud for big data and computation. It now hosts the SDAccel development environment for companies who want to streamline evaluations and accelerate FPGA kernels. 

Nimbix offers a variety of FPGA resources including the [Alveo Accelerator card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html). See full list of available hardware here: [Xilinx FPGAs on Nimbix](boards.md)
